# Implementation Summary - Event Export/Import & Demo Removal

## Date
2025-10-10

## Objective
1. Remove the Demo section from the application
2. Add export/import functionality for events with all their sessions and laps
3. Move lap management functionality into each session (already existed in EventDetail.js)

## Changes Made

### 1. Files Deleted
- `frontend/src/pages/EventFullDemo.tsx` - Demo component
- `EVENTFULLDEMO_README.md` - Demo documentation
- `EVENT_UTILS_README.md` - Event utils documentation  
- `IMPLEMENTAZIONE_RIEPILOGO.md` - Implementation summary

### 2. Files Modified

#### `frontend/src/App.js`
- Removed `EventFullDemo` import
- Removed Demo route (`/demo`)
- Removed Demo navigation link from menu

**Changes:**
- Lines removed: Import statement for EventFullDemo
- Lines removed: Route for `/demo`
- Lines removed: Navigation link to Demo page

#### `frontend/src/pages/EventDetail.js`
- Added `handleExportEvent()` function - exports event with all sessions and laps to `.rcme` file
- Added `handleImportEvent()` function - imports event from `.rcme` file and creates new event
- Added export button "ðŸ’¾ Esporta Evento"
- Added import button "ðŸ“‚ Importa Evento" (as label with hidden file input)
- Updated UI to show both buttons alongside existing "Archivia su OneDrive" button

**Export functionality:**
- Fetches all sessions for the event
- Fetches all laps for each session
- Creates JSON file with complete event data
- Downloads as `.rcme` file (Racing Car Manager Event)
- Filename format: `event_<EventName>_<Date>.rcme`

**Import functionality:**
- Reads and validates `.rcme` file
- Shows confirmation dialog with event name and session count
- Creates new event with "(Importato)" suffix
- Recreates all sessions with original configuration
- Recreates all laps with complete timing data
- Redirects to events list after successful import

### 3. Files Created

#### `EVENT_EXPORT_IMPORT_README.md`
- Complete documentation for export/import functionality
- Usage instructions
- File format specification
- Technical implementation details
- Error handling information
- Use cases and examples

## File Format (.rcme)

The `.rcme` file is a JSON file containing:

```json
{
  "event": {
    // Event metadata (name, track, dates, weather, notes, etc.)
  },
  "sessions": [
    {
      // Session configuration
      "laps": [
        // Complete lap timing data
      ]
    }
  ],
  "exportDate": "ISO date",
  "version": "1.0"
}
```

## Testing Performed

### Manual Testing
1. âœ… Created test event "Test Event Monza 2024"
2. âœ… Added FP1 session with fuel configuration
3. âœ… Added lap with 4-sector timing
4. âœ… Exported event to file successfully
5. âœ… Imported event from file successfully
6. âœ… Verified imported event has all data intact
7. âœ… Confirmed Demo link removed from navigation menu
8. âœ… Build completed successfully with no errors

### Build Verification
```
npm run build
Compiled successfully.

```

## Screenshots

1. **Event detail page with export/import buttons**
   - Shows the new "ðŸ’¾ Esporta Evento" and "ðŸ“‚ Importa Evento" buttons
   - Session with lap data displayed

2. **Successfully imported event**
   - Event with "(Importato)" suffix
   - All sessions and laps preserved

3. **Menu without Demo option**
   - Clean navigation menu without Demo link
   - Confirms successful removal

## Technical Details

### Export Implementation
- Uses `sessionAPI.getLaps()` to fetch laps for each session
- Creates JSON blob with complete event data
- Uses browser download API to save file
- Generates descriptive filename based on event name and date

### Import Implementation
- Reads file using FileReader API
- Validates JSON structure
- Shows user confirmation dialog
- Creates event via `eventAPI.create()`
- Creates sessions via `eventAPI.createSession()`
- Creates laps via `sessionAPI.createLap()`
- Handles errors with user-friendly messages
- Resets file input to allow re-import of same file

### Data Preservation
All event data is preserved during export/import:
- Event metadata (name, track, dates, weather, notes, track_length)
- Session configuration (type, number, duration, fuel, tire set, status, notes)
- Complete lap data (lap number, timing, sectors, fuel, tire set, status, notes)

## Compatibility

- Works with existing backend API
- Compatible with all session types (Test, FP1, FP2, FP3, Q, R1, R2, Endurance)
- Supports all lap timing features:
  - 4-sector timing
  - Fuel consumption tracking
  - Tire set tracking
  - Lap status (RF, FCY, SC, TFC)
  - Notes

## Use Cases

1. **Backup** - Regular export of events for offline backup
2. **Sharing** - Share event data with team members
3. **Migration** - Transfer data between installations
4. **Analysis** - Export for external analysis tools
5. **Archive** - Keep historical event data in files

## Notes

- Each import creates a new event (doesn't overwrite)
- Import process is sequential (sessions and laps created one by one)
- Large events may take a few seconds to import
- File extension `.rcme` helps identify Racing Car Manager Event files
- "(Importato)" suffix prevents confusion with original events

## Conclusion

All requirements successfully implemented:
- âœ… Demo section completely removed
- âœ… Export/import functionality working perfectly
- âœ… Lap management already available in EventDetail.js for each session
- âœ… Build successful with no errors
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation provided
- âœ… Manual testing confirms all features work correctly
