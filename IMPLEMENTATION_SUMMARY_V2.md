# Implementation Summary - Event Export/Import Enhancement

## Date
2024-10-10

## Objective
Modificare il file di salvataggio/importazione evento in modo che lo stesso contenga anche TUTTI i runplan generati per l'evento e anche il Tire Pressure database generato all'interno dello stesso.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified Files

#### `frontend/src/pages/EventDetail.js`

**Export Functionality (`handleExportEvent`):**
- Added retrieval of RunPlan history from localStorage (key: 'runPlanSheet_history')
- Added retrieval of Tire Pressure database from localStorage (key: 'tirePressureDatabase')
- Updated export data structure to include:
  - `runPlans`: Array of all RunPlan entries
  - `tirePressureDatabase`: Array of all tire pressure entries
- Updated version number from "1.0" to "2.0" to reflect the enhanced format

**Import Functionality (`handleImportEvent`):**
- Enhanced confirmation dialog to show counts of:
  - RunPlans included in the import file
  - Tire Pressure database entries included in the import file
- Added import logic for RunPlans:
  - Retrieves existing RunPlan history from localStorage
  - Generates new unique IDs for imported RunPlans
  - Adds imported timestamp
  - Marks entries with `imported: true` flag
  - Appends to existing history
- Added import logic for Tire Pressure database:
  - Retrieves existing tire pressure database from localStorage
  - Generates new unique IDs for imported entries
  - Marks entries with `imported: true` flag
  - Appends to existing database

#### `EVENT_EXPORT_IMPORT_README.md`
- Updated file format documentation to show new structure including:
  - `runPlans` array with sample data
  - `tirePressureDatabase` array with sample data
  - Version "2.0"
- Updated Features section to mention RunPlans and Tire Pressure database
- Updated Technical Details sections for both export and import implementations
- Maintained backward compatibility documentation

### 2. New Files Created

#### `EXPORT_IMPORT_TEST_GUIDE.md`
Comprehensive testing guide including:
- Test Scenario 1: Export Event with All Data
- Test Scenario 2: Import Event with All Data
- Test Scenario 3: Backward Compatibility (v1.0 files)
- Test Scenario 4: Empty Data Arrays
- Expected Behavior Summary
- Known Behaviors
- Troubleshooting Guide

#### `sample_export_v2.rcme`
Sample export file demonstrating the new v2.0 format with:
- Event metadata
- Session with 2 laps
- 1 RunPlan entry with complete data structure
- 2 Tire Pressure database entries
- Version "2.0"

## File Format Changes

### Version 1.0 (Old Format)
```json
{
  "event": { ... },
  "sessions": [ ... ],
  "exportDate": "...",
  "version": "1.0"
}
```

### Version 2.0 (New Format)
```json
{
  "event": { ... },
  "sessions": [ ... ],
  "runPlans": [ ... ],
  "tirePressureDatabase": [ ... ],
  "exportDate": "...",
  "version": "2.0"
}
```

## Key Features

### Export
✅ Exports all event data (metadata, sessions, laps)
✅ Exports all RunPlans from localStorage
✅ Exports all Tire Pressure database entries from localStorage
✅ Handles empty data arrays gracefully
✅ Maintains backward compatibility (can export even without RunPlans/Tire Pressure data)

### Import
✅ Imports all event data (creates new event with sessions and laps)
✅ Imports RunPlans into localStorage with unique IDs
✅ Imports Tire Pressure entries into localStorage with unique IDs
✅ Shows enhanced confirmation dialog with data counts
✅ Marks imported entries with `imported: true` flag
✅ Backward compatible with v1.0 files (handles missing fields gracefully)
✅ Appends to existing localStorage data (doesn't replace)

## Data Storage

### RunPlans
- **Storage**: localStorage
- **Key**: `runPlanSheet_history`
- **Structure**: Array of RunPlan objects
- **Import Behavior**: Appends with new unique IDs and timestamps

### Tire Pressure Database
- **Storage**: localStorage
- **Key**: `tirePressureDatabase`
- **Structure**: Array of PressureEntry objects
- **Import Behavior**: Appends with new unique IDs

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation is fully backward compatible:
- V2.0 files can be imported (with RunPlans and Tire Pressure data)
- V1.0 files can be imported (without RunPlans and Tire Pressure data)
- Missing `runPlans` or `tirePressureDatabase` fields are handled gracefully
- No errors occur when importing older format files

## Testing

### Build Test
✅ Frontend builds successfully without errors
✅ No TypeScript or JavaScript errors
✅ All dependencies resolve correctly

### Manual Testing Required
Refer to `EXPORT_IMPORT_TEST_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive testing scenarios including:
1. Export with all data
2. Import and verification
3. Backward compatibility
4. Empty data arrays

## Notes

### Important Behaviors
1. **Unique IDs**: Imported entries get new unique IDs to prevent conflicts
2. **Timestamps**: RunPlans get new timestamps on import
3. **Imported Flag**: Entries are marked with `imported: true` for tracking
4. **Append Mode**: Import appends to existing data rather than replacing
5. **No Duplicate Check**: System doesn't check for duplicates - importing the same file twice creates duplicates

### Limitations
- No validation that RunPlans or Tire Pressure entries actually belong to the imported event
- All RunPlans and Tire Pressure entries from localStorage are exported (not filtered by event)
- No duplicate detection on import

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. Filter RunPlans by event name before export
2. Filter Tire Pressure entries by session/event before export
3. Add duplicate detection on import
4. Add option to merge or replace on import
5. Add validation that imported data matches the event

## Conclusion

The event export/import functionality has been successfully enhanced to include:
- ✅ All RunPlans generated for the event
- ✅ Complete Tire Pressure database

The implementation:
- Maintains backward compatibility with v1.0 files
- Uses minimal code changes
- Follows existing patterns in the codebase
- Includes comprehensive documentation and testing guides
- Handles edge cases gracefully

Version number has been updated from "1.0" to "2.0" to reflect the enhanced format.
