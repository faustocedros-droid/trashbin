# ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Event Export/Import v2.0

## 🎯 Objective Achieved
Il file di salvatamento/importazione evento (.rcme) ora contiene:
- ✅ TUTTI i runplan generati per l'evento
- ✅ Il Tire Pressure database generato all'interno dello stesso

## 📋 Files Modified

### Core Functionality
- **`frontend/src/pages/EventDetail.js`** - Enhanced export/import functions
  - Export now includes RunPlans and Tire Pressure database from localStorage
  - Import now restores RunPlans and Tire Pressure database to localStorage
  - Version upgraded from "1.0" to "2.0"

### Documentation
- **`EVENT_EXPORT_IMPORT_README.md`** - Updated to document new v2.0 format
- **`EXPORT_IMPORT_TEST_GUIDE.md`** - NEW: Comprehensive testing guide
- **`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_V2.md`** - NEW: Detailed implementation summary
- **`sample_export_v2.rcme`** - NEW: Sample export file with all data

## 🔑 Key Changes

### Export Function (handleExportEvent)
```javascript
// Now exports:
{
  event: { ... },
  sessions: [ ... ],
  runPlans: [ ... ],              // NEW: All RunPlans from localStorage
  tirePressureDatabase: [ ... ],  // NEW: All Tire Pressure entries
  exportDate: "...",
  version: "2.0"                  // UPDATED: from 1.0
}
```

### Import Function (handleImportEvent)
```javascript
// Now imports:
- Event metadata and sessions (as before)
- RunPlans → localStorage with unique IDs
- Tire Pressure database → localStorage with unique IDs
- Shows counts in confirmation dialog
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Export an Event
1. Navigate to any event detail page
2. Click **"💾 Esporta Evento"**
3. The downloaded `.rcme` file now includes RunPlans and Tire Pressure data

### Import an Event
1. Navigate to any event detail page
2. Click **"📂 Importa Evento"**
3. Select a `.rcme` file
4. Confirmation dialog shows:
   - Event name and sessions count
   - **NEW:** RunPlans count (if present)
   - **NEW:** Tire Pressure entries count (if present)
5. Confirm to import

## ✨ Features

### Export
- ✅ Exports all event data (metadata, sessions, laps)
- ✅ Exports ALL RunPlans from localStorage
- ✅ Exports ALL Tire Pressure database entries from localStorage
- ✅ Works even if RunPlans or Tire Pressure data is empty

### Import
- ✅ Imports all event data
- ✅ Imports RunPlans with unique IDs to localStorage
- ✅ Imports Tire Pressure entries with unique IDs to localStorage
- ✅ Enhanced confirmation dialog with data counts
- ✅ **Backward compatible** with v1.0 files
- ✅ Appends to existing data (doesn't replace)

## 🧪 Testing

### Build Status
✅ Frontend builds successfully without errors

### Test Instructions
See **`EXPORT_IMPORT_TEST_GUIDE.md`** for:
- Export/Import test scenarios
- Backward compatibility tests
- Verification steps
- Troubleshooting guide

### Sample Data
See **`sample_export_v2.rcme`** for example of v2.0 format

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**
- V2.0 files can be imported (with RunPlans and Tire Pressure)
- V1.0 files can be imported (without RunPlans and Tire Pressure)
- Missing fields are handled gracefully
- No errors when importing older format files

## 📊 Data Storage

### RunPlans
- **Source**: localStorage key `runPlanSheet_history`
- **Export**: All entries included
- **Import**: Appended with new unique IDs

### Tire Pressure Database
- **Source**: localStorage key `tirePressureDatabase`
- **Export**: All entries included
- **Import**: Appended with new unique IDs

## 🎨 UI Changes

### Export Button
- No visual changes
- Same button: **"💾 Esporta Evento"**
- Now exports more data

### Import Button
- No visual changes
- Same button: **"📂 Importa Evento"**
- Enhanced confirmation dialog shows data counts

## 📝 Notes

### Important Behaviors
1. **Unique IDs**: Imported entries get new IDs to prevent conflicts
2. **Timestamps**: RunPlans get new timestamps on import
3. **Imported Flag**: Entries marked with `imported: true`
4. **Append Mode**: Import appends to existing data
5. **No Duplicate Check**: Importing same file twice creates duplicates

### Current Limitations
- All RunPlans and Tire Pressure entries are exported (not filtered by event)
- No validation that imported data belongs to the event
- No duplicate detection

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. Filter RunPlans/Tire Pressure by event before export
2. Add duplicate detection on import
3. Add option to merge or replace on import
